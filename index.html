    <h1>Hi, I'm Sujen Kancherla.</h1>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a masters degree in Machine Learning and Data Science at UCSD. 
        I previously finished my Bachelors in Data Science at UCSD. I have always wanted to be a positive influence and impact on those around me,
        and at the same time learning from my own self growth journey. I am looking for oppurtunites 
        where I can have a positive impact on people through making a product or with useful research. 
        Although I do not have a specific domain of interest within Articificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I am confident in my foundational skills in various concepts, 
        such as Computer Vision, Natural Language, Recommender Systems and Reinforcement Learning</p>

            <div class="description">
                <p>Using the ESRGAN paper, I followed the architecture in PyTorch to train a GAN model 
                    with a Generator and Discriminator training off of each other. I have python scripts 
                    to convert the torch model to onnx and locally host it as an API.</p>

                <p>Using the minimax and depth limited minimax, I created an AI chess and Tic Tac Toe player. 
                    I used pygame to create the ui for the chess game, and it runs locally only.</p>

                <p>Conducted research on various different loss functions to train the GPT-2 model. 
                    We used perplexity as a metric to evaluate performance of the language model after training it on squared loss, a hybrid loss function, etc.
                We used pytorch to train the open source code for GPT-2 on the TinyStories dataset.</p>

                <p>Used eigenvectors of gradients in image to find corners in two images. Then matched the corners using SIFT. using the matched corners, 
                    with 8-point algorithm and RANSAC. the Fundamental matrix is created that allows one image to be transformed into the camera projection of the other image, 
                    which creates a panoramic stitching between the two.</p>
